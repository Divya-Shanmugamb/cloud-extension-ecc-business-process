# Configuration of Eventing in On-Premise Backend and SAP Event Mesh

## Introduction

In this section, you will learn how to configure your on-premise backend system to use the SAP NetWeaver Add-On for Event Enablement Service Pack SP03. If you have installed only Service Pack SP01 or SP02, please use the [SP01 Setup Guide](./SETUP_SP01.md). In SP03, the setup has been simplified and the events are now compatible to standard SAP S/4HANA events.

**Audience:** Basis ABAP Administrator

### Configure Logical Message Types

WE81 (Logical message types) is a standard SAP parameter transaction code that is used to maintain the contents of VEDI\_EDMSG database table. It does this by executing the table maintenance t-code SM30 in edit mode, assuming you have the appropriate authorisations.

1. Choose the back icon to go to the home screen and enter transaction **/nWE81** and then choose **Display/Change**. For the warning that the change is cross-client, choose **Ok**.

    ![goto Logical Msg Type](./images/gotoLogicalMsgType.png)
    
2. Choose field **New Entries**.
3. Add the following two Message types:
   - Enter Message Type: **Z\_ACI\_MSG\_CREATED**
   - Enter any meaningful text in the field: **Short Text**
   - Add another Message Type: **Z\_ACI\_MSG\_CHANGED**
   - Enter a meaningful short text.	
   - Choose **Save**.

   	![add Message Types](./images/addMessageTypes.png)

4. When you try to save, it prompts you to create a Transport Request for any Cross Object. Choose the **Create** icon to create a new Workbench request.

   ![prompt For Workbench Request](./images/promptForWorkbenchRequest.png)

5. Enter a meaningful text in the **Short Description** field and then choose **Save**.

   ![create Transport Request](./images/createTransportRequest1.png)

6. Choose the **Green tick mark** icon in the screen to save the Object in Transport. Once Transport is created, for any further cross object changes, you can capture the change in the same transport number/Request which you have created. You will be prompted with similar "Transport Request"/ "Customizing Request" in the next steps, you can reuse the same Transport request which you created now.

   ![create Transport Request](./images/createTransportRequest2.png)
